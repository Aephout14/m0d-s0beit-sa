# in GTA's Advanced Graphics menu.  This does not effect maximum FPS with Frame Limiter off.
# GTA's default for this is a mere 25 FPS.  We recommend enabling "Frame Limiter" in GTA's menu
# and setting this to around whatever your average maximum FPS normally is, for a much smoother
# gaming experience...  especially with SA:MP.  You can try even a tad lower FPS, and notice that
# world objects load a lot faster.  Our default is 60 FPS because this matches a lot of LCD monitors
# which can't even display more than 60 FPS.  Hopefully this clears this up for newbs thinking we just
# added an FPS limiter.  We did not.  It's been in GTA this whole time.  All we're doing is providing an
# easy way to always make sure it's the value that you want, if you decide to have VSync enabled.
# The major advantage of VSync is visual quality, because it prevents image tearing between frames.
